                                    All 18 Diary study participants completed a brief survey. This mixed-methods, post-activity survey asked whether participants found taking photos to be a boring or interesting task, about the importance of getting outside to support physical and mental health during COVID, how connected participants felt to their neighborhood and how important neighbrohood connectivity was to them. We analysed our survey results in Excel and summarized our findings in a slide-deck.

                <p>For our first attempt at design, we each drafted up our own ideas of the apps navigation and core features. After sharing our designs, we voted on the most desirable features and confirmed the expected features of the app.</p>

                    <p>Here are a few examples of our iterative changes throughout the testing process.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <h5>1. On-screen, Live Map</h5>
                        <li>Users loved the combination of an <b>Augmented Reality (AR), real-time view</b>. However, users thought the location marker looked like a video ‘play’ button, and once you click into a pin they were unsure what to do next. Also, they were unsure why the pin was called space needle when it wasn’t directly on it. </li>
                       <a href="assets/images/iteration1.png"><img src="assets/images/iteration1.png"></a>
                        <li><b>Changes: Adjusted location marker, made CTA language more clear, and added elements to display the pin is user-generated</b></li>
                        <h5>2. Pin Profile Page</h5>
                        <li>Once you get close to the pin, users were confused and one commented that the UI for our arrival screen looked like an ad.</li>
                        <a href="assets/images/iteration2.png"><img src="assets/images/iteration2.png"></a>
                        <li><b>Changes: Changed the location marker to reflect the pin itself, to maintain consistence. We also changed the layout of the expanded pin to compliment the ‘Start Walking’ screen.</b></li>
                        <h5>3. User Onboarding</h5>
                        <li>Users felt like they were unclear about the app's capabilities when they arrived to the home screen. So we needed to make our onboarding very clear so the user knows functions like navigating to "Pins" and how they can share their own content. </li>
                        <a href="assets/images/iteration3.png"><img src="assets/images/iteration3.png"></a>
                        <li><b>Changes: Redesigned the onboarding experience to include more action oriented language to descibe the app’s core functions. The new design also switched from tapping ‘Next’ to navigate to the proceeding screen to a drag motion.</b></li>

                    <br>
                    <li><b>Why did we incorporate opportunities to connect?</b></li>
